### About Me  

Hi, I'm Godisgreat Nwachukwu, a passionate engineer and data analyst with a strong foundation in Mechatronics and growing expertise in Data Science and Software Development. My journey began with a love for solving problems and fixing things, and it has evolved into a mission to create impactful solutions, both in technology and the real world.

Currently, I'm developing a multi-tenant property management system with Django and django-tenant, utilizing my skills in Python, Pandas, and data analysis. I also enjoy teaching and creating detailed learning materials on SQL, Python, and data analytics.  

I thrive on working with tools like Django REST Framework (APIViews), Celery, and Redis, and I’m proficient with MS Office and Google Suites for business productivity. Whether it's optimizing market structures, automating workflows, or building insightful dashboards, I’m always excited to take on new challenges and grow.  

I’m actively seeking remote software development and data analysis opportunities that allow me to collaborate, innovate, and make a difference.  

Let’s connect and build something amazing!
